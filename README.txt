1. HOW TO PLAY

A) The Start Menu:

First, players should select a background, a character, 
and their preferred font. 
  NOTE: More backgrounds and players can be unlocked by 
  reaching certain milestones while playing both Normal 
  mode and Hard mode.

Second, they must determine their difficulty. Normal mode
is the intended experience for ages 4 to 7. 
  NOTE: Ensure the CAPS LOCK button is ON before starting 
  Normal Mode, as all words will need to be typed in all 
  caps.

Hard mode is an extra challenge intended for advanced
players. Hard mode contains new words, phrases, both 
capital and lowercase letters, and begins at a faster 
base speed. It is recommended to play Normal mode first 
to understand the basics of the game before attempting 
Hard mode.
  NOTE: Ensure CAPS LOCK is OFF before starting Hard mode,
  as proper capitalization is necessary. 

Once a mode is selected, the countdown will begin. When 
the countdown has finished, the game starts. 

B) The Gameplay:

Alien spaceships will descend from the top of the screen
and a word will be written across the front of the ship.
To stop the alien from reaching Earth, you must type the
word shown over the alien into the text box provided at
the bottom of the game window, then press the ENTER key
when the word is complete.

A successfully typed word will charge your character's 
laser, and pressing ENTER will fire the laser at the 
alien's ship, destroying it.

Correctly typed letters in the text box will cause the
corresponding letters on the alien ships to turn from
red to green. This means you are typing the right word!

In Normal Mode, there are five (5) levels of increasing
difficulty: 
   Level One: 10 random three-letter words
   Level Two: 10 random four-letter words
   Level Three: 10 random five-letter words
   Level Four: 10 random six-letter words
   Level Five: 10 random seven-letter words
As each level passes, the alien ships also descend faster,
so being able to type quickly and accurately is key!

In Hard Mode, there are no Levels. Words are randomized and
might be very long or very short. The goal of Hard Mode is
to achieve the highest score you possibly can. The highest
score possible in Hard Mode is 500.
